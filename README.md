# python-visual-hull
This is the Python implementation for creating object visual hulls from camera masks. The code is adapted from https://github.com/maximm8/VisualHull which is in MATLAB.

## In Progress
Eventually, I'm hoping to use the code to create depth hulls using RGB-D images from Berkeley's BigBIRD dataset [http://rll.berkeley.edu/bigbird/].
